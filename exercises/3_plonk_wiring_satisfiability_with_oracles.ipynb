    "#### Main idea\n",
    "The idea will be that the vector $V$ is a shuffle of the vector $W$ with high probability if for a random coefficient $\\alpha$ the product $(v_0 + \\alpha)\\cdots(v_N + \\alpha)$ equals $(w_0 + \\alpha)\\cdots(w_N + \\alpha)$. This an application of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma (think about it!).\n",

    "#### A handy kind of polynomials\n",
    "Any polynomial $Z$ that satisfies $$Z(\\omega^i)\\cdot(v_i + \\alpha) = Z(\\omega^{i+1})\\cdot(w_i + \\alpha),$$ for all $i=0,\\dots, N-1$ also satisfies $$Z(\\omega^{i+1}) = Z(1)\\frac{(v_0 + \\alpha)\\cdots(v_i + \\alpha)}{(w_0 + \\alpha)\\cdots(w_i + \\alpha)}$$ for $i=0,\\dots, N-1$.\n",
    "In particular, for $i=N-1$ this last equality implies $$Z(1) = Z(1)\\frac{(v_0 + \\alpha)\\cdots(v_N + \\alpha)}{(w_0 + \\alpha)\\cdots(w_N + \\alpha)}.$$\n",
    "There are only two cases. Either $Z(1) = 0$ or $Z(1) \\neq 0$  🦆. The latter case implies $(v_0 + \\alpha)\\cdots(v_N + \\alpha) = (w_0 + \\alpha)\\cdots(w_N + \\alpha).$\n",

    "#### Summary\n",
    "So, putting this all together we obtain the following claim.\n",
