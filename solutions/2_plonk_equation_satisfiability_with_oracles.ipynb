This means that the set can have 4 equations or $2^{20}$ and the code will run in the same time. This is still silly and useless since for it to be true the verifier needs to read the instances of the oracles from the python interpreter's memory of the prover. If these would have been sent over the network, the verifier would need to read them and that would be expensive."
