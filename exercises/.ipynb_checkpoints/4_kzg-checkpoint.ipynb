    "The construction of the \"oracles\" will be solved using the concept of \"polynomial commitments\". These are values that are binded to the polynomial without revealing its exact form. This value is derived from the polynomial in such a way that it’s very hard to figure out the original polynomial just by looking at the commitment. However, this commitment is still uniquely tied to the original polynomial (with overwhelming probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "In KZG these will be instantiated using two ideas: (Elliptic Curve) Discrete Log Problem + Schwarz-Zippel Lemma. Say I have a polynomial $f$ and compute $f(\\tau) G$ for some random element $\\tau$. Since the discrete log problem is hard in elliptic curves, it's very unlikely that someone with access to $f(\\tau)G$ will be able to obtain $f(\\tau)$. So, the value $f(\\tau) G$ reveals nothing about the original polynomial $f$. On the other hand, if $g(\\tau) G$ equals $f(\\tau) G$ for some other polynomial $g$, then $f(\\tau)$ equals $g(\\tau)$. Since $\\tau$ is random, we deduce that $f$ equals $g$ as polynomials. And thus, $f(\\tau) G$ is uniquely tied to the original polynomial with overwhelming probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "One first problem is that the above works as long as the random value $\\tau$ is not known to the committing party. Or otherwise it could craft polynomials that are different but take the same value at $\\tau$, breaking the purpose of the commitment. So, how can anyone compute $f(\\tau)G$ without knowing $\\tau$? The solution is what's called an SRS. There are protocols that can be run between multiple parties producing the following list of points\n",

    "for a random element $\\tau$ not known to any party (as long as one party is honest). This list of elements is called an SRS.\n",
    "Having such list solves the problem, since:\n",
    "- The value of $\\tau$ can't be computed off the list assuming the DLOG problem is hard.\n",
    "- The commiting party can compute $f(\\tau) G$ as $$f_0G + f_1 \\tau G + f_2 \\tau^2 G + \\cdots + f_k \\tau^k G,$$ where $f_i$ is the $i$-th coefficient of $f$ in the monomial basis. The only constraint is that the degree of $f$ must be at most $N$.\n"
